I played Digital forensics, misc and binary exploitation during the fierce qualifying rounds of CSAW'23, the competition was intense, challenging our team's imagination more than the technical skills. The CTF was more of puzzling and tricky challenges, we were playing on a summer night in the office to secure a ticket for SOter14 to the finals in the New York University of Abu Dhabi, and just like last year's edition, we finished first in the MENA region.

Every journey begins with a first step, and for me, that step was not just onto the cybersecurity competition of CSAW'23 but also into the skies. I was so excited to fly the Emirates and represent my team in the finals. My determination is fueled by the unwavering belief and support of my family and Adam, SOter14, my friends, and the whole INSAT university.

I have always dreamt to be in the CSAW finals since I started playing CTFs two years ago, I spent the days before the flight picturing places I can go to for four days and gaining the most of sleep before traveling as I knew I will be sleepless for the next four days, I know that doesn't sound like me, but I did it!

At the Tunis Carthage Internation Airport an hour before heading to Dubai, on Novemeber the 8th.

It was a long flight for more than five hours, I liked the served food and the entertainment system, but mostly the view outside. As the plane descended into the bustling city of Dubai, my eyes widened with anticipation. I started seeing the future with all the glittering lights of the metropolis painting a surreal scene below me, a prelude to the awe-inspiring spectacle that awaited me for four unforgettable days.

I arrived the first hour of the next morning in Dubai International Airport, my first glimpse of Dubai, I entered a realm of marvels, where all vibrant lights meet the modern engineering. The size of the airport was overwhelming, stretching in every direction, a city within itself.

Dubai, it breathes life into the night, unfolded before me as I keep photographing every step of the way leading to the hotel. The smooth road beneath the wheels like a magical ribbon guiding me through a luminescent labyrinth of lights on both sides, the city skyling being the masterpiece of it all.

It takes around an hour and thirty minutes to go from Dubai to Abu Dhabi, and I've never felt exhausted, I was wide awake, ready to discover the hotel surroundings, I just kept my stuff in the room, and went exploring the streets, trying some chinese food and taking pictures of the city.

We were already in the early morning hours and by the sunrise, I got my breakfast at the hotel, trying every available cheese, and then we set off to the nearest mall, Wehda mall, one of the biggest malls in Abu Dhabi I visited along with Abu Dhabi Mall, I was amazed by the size of the mall, and the number of shops, I bought some souvenirs and then we went to the beach, the weather was so hot during the day so we got back to the hotel to get some rest before the opening ceremony of the CTF.

I noticed how clean the cars were, and the organization of traffic, street cats are missing a little care, I was patting them, I missed my family, Adam, and my cat.

For thirty-six hours straight, we were solving challenges, I liked New York University of Abu Dhabi, it has a nice sea view, palms everywhere, a lot of student spaces and libraries. The final round was very alike to the qualifiers, we were solving challenges in the same categories, but this time, the challenges were more difficult and the competition was more intense, we were competing against the best teams in the region and worldwide. They served eastern food of different kinds, I liked the sweet potato, the falafel, and the sausage. I was so excited to meet other middle eastern teams and know people from Jordan and Egypt, they were so friendly and we went to a traditional emirati restaurant after the competition.

We played till the last minute, and we were so close to the third place, a sense of happiness and pride engulfed our team. We ranked 4th in the MENA region and 17th globally.

We returned to Tunis on November the 12th around midday, I was very sleepy...
